# Analysis Protocol

## Analysis Completion Check

Before delivering a conclusion that informs a business decision, confirm
all dimensions have been examined. If any are missing, state what's missing
and frame the answer as preliminary.

1. **RATE** — Is the unit price / unit economics changing?
2. **VOLUME** — Is the quantity of work changing?
3. **MIX** — Is the composition of work shifting?
4. **STRUCTURE** — Are comp/cost models uniform across subjects?
5. **EFFORT** — Are workloads comparable?
6. **COHORT** — Who's in the analysis and why? Would the conclusion change if the cohort changed?

> "Based on pricing data alone, the answer appears to be X. However, I haven't
> yet examined volume trends or whether workloads are comparable. Should we
> look at those before finalizing?"

## When to Apply
- Output drives a dollar decision
- Multiple stakeholders compared
- Someone could reasonably ask "but what about...?" after seeing the result

## When to Skip
- Simple lookups
- Single-dimension queries
- Exploratory framing
